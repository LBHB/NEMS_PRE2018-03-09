In no particular order:

- User login with saved selections.

- Finish implementing plot types from NARF Analysis

- Add significance info to bar plot

- Customize pareto plot to match NARF instead of using box plot

- Speed up status report for large batches
  (need to filter query somehow? or is performance limited by heatmap?)

- Get bokeh to save grid plots as one file instead of individuals

- fix issues w/ positioning of bokeh toolbar - it either sit way off to the right
  or mashes into title/whatever axis it sits on. waiting on fix from bokeh
  for non-sticky toolbar.

- switch analysis editor to use id instead of name for querying

- make table columns resizeable

- switch table selection to DataTables implementation instead of custom JS
  to add in ctrl/shift select etc.
  (added ctrl select with current implementation for now)
      
- interface for uploading and running data from outside lab

- able to reload modules/lib stuff
  (how would this affect saved models if module changed)
  (note: use importlib.reload(module))
  (note: looks like pickle loads the old module -- had error when loading
   an old fit model that was still trying to point to lib.xxx imports, but
   re-fitting the model fixed it)
  
- ability to run custom scripts from directory on selected results

- finish config for session/cookie management w/ flask login
  (ex. session timeout duration? shouldn't stay logged in forever)
  (ex. which views should require a 'fresh' login even for saved session?)
  
- integrate AWS

- set up SSL context for neuralprediction (i.e. https / secure hosting )
