- Finish implementing plot types from NARF Analysis

- Add significance info to bar plot

- Customize pareto plot to match NARF instead of using box plot

- Get bokeh to save grid plots as one file instead of individuals

- link up enqueue models to cluster

- switch analysis editor to use id instead of name for querying

- make table columns resizeable

  to add in ctrl/shift select etc.
  (added ctrl select with current implementation for now)

- able to reload modules/lib stuff
  (how would this affect saved models if module changed)

- ability to run custom scripts from directory on selected results

- finish config for session/cookie management w/ flask login
  (ex. session timeout duration? shouldn't stay logged in forever)
  (ex. which views should require a 'fresh' login even for saved session?)
