class ModelFinder():
    """Converts a modeltree string from NarfAnalysis into a list of modelnames.
    
    Invokes a series of internal methods on any modeltree string passed to
    its constructor.
    First, string_to_nested_list cleans up the string to match the syntax for
        nested python lists, and interprets the string as a list using
        ast.literal_eval.
    Then, traverse_nested recursively finds all combinations of the strings
        (i.e. 'keywords') inside the lists and stores them in self.comboArray.
    Finally, array_to_list converts each list of strings contained in
        self.comboArray into a string concatenation of the list separated
        with underscores, and stores a list of the strings in self.modellist.
    self.modellist is ultimately used by the update_models view function in
        nems_analysis.views.
    
    Arguments:
    ----------
    modelstring : string
        A model tree specified in a NarfAnalysis entry, resembling a nested
        list, ex: {'an','example',{'tree','string'}}
