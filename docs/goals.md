# Goals of NEMS 'dev' branch #

The goals of the refactored NEMS project are: 

1. BAYESIAN PARAMETER SUPPORT. We want to estimate parameter distributions, not just a single value of a parameter. 

2. STANDALONE OPERATION. This branch should not depend on any databases and should run without an internet connection.

3. MINIMALISM. Our code should not need anything not strictly necessary and strive for implementational simplicity.

4. (TODO) 


Not immediate goals:

1. Queuing models on our cluster
2. Web interface visualizations
3. Code sharing with other groups
