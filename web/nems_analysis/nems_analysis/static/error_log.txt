1) losing database connection when hosting from amazon server. usually stays on for several hours
    then loses the connection at some point. Some times get a "broken pipeline" error, other times this:
        
    DatabaseError: Execution failed on sql: SELECT name FROM NarfAnalysis LIMIT 1000
    (2013, 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query') unable to rollback
    
    
2) ast.literal_eval is now working for the majority of the model strings, but a few still won't work
    even after fixing every syntax error I was able to identify.
    
3) having issues getting jquery to pick up on value of drop-down checkboxes for
    column selections for results table. Still a work-in-progress, doesn't currently
    update the results table display
