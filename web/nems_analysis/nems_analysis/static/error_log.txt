1) losing database connection when hosting from amazon server. usually stays on for several hours
    then loses the connection at some point. Some times get a "broken pipeline" error, other times this:
        
    DatabaseError: Execution failed on sql: SELECT name FROM NarfAnalysis LIMIT 1000
    (2013, 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query') unable to rollback
    
    
2) ast.literal_eval only works for about half of the model strings. either need to identify
    common patterns in the strings taht can be corrected by string.replace() or other methods,
    or need to define a new function for converting the strings to nested lists.
