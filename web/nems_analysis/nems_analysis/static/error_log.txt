- preview button currently will only load the figurefile for the topmost selected row, instead of
     opening one window per selection like narf_analysis. seems to be some issue with using
     window.open() inside of a loop with javascript.
     
- database errors for remote server appear to be mostly fixed. still get an occasional
    'broken pipeline' error but goes away on second attempt to connect.

- ast.literal_eval should now be working for all analyses with a model string - will still
    pop up error message in model selector if no modelstring exists for the selected analysis.
