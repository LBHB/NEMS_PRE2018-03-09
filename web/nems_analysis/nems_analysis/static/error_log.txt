1a) losing database connection when hosting from amazon server. usually stays on for several hours
    then loses the connection at some point. Some times get a "broken pipeline" error, other times this:
        
    DatabaseError: Execution failed on sql: SELECT name FROM NarfAnalysis LIMIT 1000
    (2013, 'Lost connection to MySQL server during query') unable to rollback
    
1b) another database error:
    "StatementError: (sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError) 
    Can't reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back"
    
    Need to look at proper procedures for opening and closing sessions, rolling back
    queries, etc with SQL alchemy.

    Not seeing these errors when hosting locally, but may be due to restarting the
    application every time a file changes via debugger.
    
2) ast.literal_eval should now be working for all analyses with a model string - will still
    pop up error message in model selector if no modelstring exists for the selected analysis.
