- adding or editing an analysis is done via form submission and as such will reset
    the main page to default settings after submission. May want to change to be handled
    by ajax request instead, but when user defaults/saved selections are implemented
    this will likely be a moot point. low priority for now.

- preview button currently will only load the figurefile for the topmost selected row, instead of
     opening one window per selection like narf_analysis. seems to be some issue with using
     window.open() inside of a loop with javascript.
     
- database errors for remote server appear to be mostly fixed. still get an occasional
    'broken pipeline' error but goes away on second attempt to connect.
        -pipeline error may have been fixed with pool_reset - haven't seen it since the change.

- ast.literal_eval should now be working for all analyses with a model string - will still
    pop up error message in model selector if no modelstring exists for the selected analysis.
