- preview button currently will only load the figurefile for the topmost selected row, instead of
     opening one window per selection like narf_analysis. seems to be some issue with using
     window.open() inside of a loop with javascript.
     
- database errors for remote server appear to be cleared up now.

- ast.literal_eval should now be working for all analyses with a model string - will still
    pop up error message in model selector if no modelstring exists for the selected analysis.
