- mpld3 appears to be inverting the strf image in the modelpane (via figure.to_html)
  compared to the preview .png (plt's .save_fig(.png)). Looks like it's a known
  issue: https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3/issues/198
  Will need to find a work-around or re-design how modelpane gets its images.
  Possible to host matplotlib.pyplot images directly via embedded WebAgg,
  but would need to host on separate server?
  https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/gallery/user_interfaces/embedding_webagg_sgskip.html

- preview button currently will only load the figurefile for the topmost selected row, instead of
     opening one window per selection like narf_analysis. seems to be some issue with using
     window.open() inside of a loop with javascript.

- ast.literal_eval should now be working for all analyses with a model string - will still
    pop up error message in model selector if no modelstring exists for the selected analysis.
